    "descripcion":"<p>Crops from the Vaccinium genera belong to the Ericaceas family. Their species are widely distributed in Europe and USA. Vaccinium genera are classified in two groups: Male Blueberries (Blueberries, heildelbeere) and Female Blueberries (Cranberries, Poiselbeere, Airelles).</p><p>There are mainly two types: Highbush blueberry and rabbiteyes blueberry.</p><p>The first is characterized for being self fertile variety, and then plantings can be established as only one cultivar (variety), even though it has been verified, when two or three varieties are placed in the orchard, larger size and early maturity fruits are obtained.</p><p>The highbush blueberry is the specie that first was planted as a crop and is the one that produces better quality in terms of size and flavor. Even though, Rabbiteyes blueberry is considered of less economical importance, it has the advantage of requiring a short winter, is not as demanding on soils and is more resistant to alkaline pH, heat and drought.</p><p>Soil: characteristics are determinant for a good Berries´ development, since their physical characteristic define roots development and crop’s water holding capacity. Also, in relation to their chemical characteristics determine essential nutrients´ availability for growing and production; besides in some cases, there are toxicity problems for the crop by the presence of some element.</p><p>Soil pH is a characteristic that define nutrients´ availability for the crop. Blueberries grow better on the following soil characteristics: humid, acid (pH 5-5.5), sandy, sandy or clay peat not very deep, and low fertility. In general, due to their humid and oxygen demands, the soil must have good drainage, high water holding capacity and porosity for proper aeration. When soils´ acidity conditions are not adequate for the blueberry crop (higher pH), it is necessary to perform management practices that allow to increase acidity (diminish soil pH). Among them, one of the most efficient and economic convenient is the application of sulfur (elemental sulfur). Even though, it must consider that a soil pH alteration affects the nutrients´ availability for the crop.</p>",
